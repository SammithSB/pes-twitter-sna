After that:

One level scraping has happened, need to continue till it reaches convergence.
a rank list based on number of people from that follow a person.
Pyviz to visualise it.

Use the html file to have a look at that.


As of now only scraping tweets for one user has happened, need to scrape tweets of all and process tweets so we only have tweets and replies that are replying to pes twitter people.
