'You might say but csk winning is fluke, maybe it was maybe it wasn’t but I’m definitely sure CSK though of it as biggest moment and be all and end all of the game, they planned what was the way to win from that situation, trued yo execute it and we’re successful.'
'A neutral audience always wants underdog to win, what better neutral audience you want than the commentators and for them if underdog has to win something special has to happen there, that’s why it’s an important over. Just like there is no choke, there are no big moments'
'Doesn’t mean they will react to it differently that necessary, they are trained to soak in pressure and do what’s best to win the game, obviously there will be times they will fail and that’s sport.\n"50 runs in 3 overs, it’s an important over" why is it so important?'
'All these stuff have an impact but don’t define result of the match. CSK lost 4 wickets in powerplay against Mumbai and rayadu was injured so essentially 5 and still they recovered and won the game.\nPlayers feel different kind of pressure for different situations yes but that'
'What I’m getting to is that every ball has equal weightage, you can’t be like this phase we don’t care and do whatever you want. The "big moments" are moments where things that shouldn’t happen happen, best player getting out, best bowler bowling no balls.'
'Thsi was general perception that day but the next day we thought wait England didn’t utilise powerplay well bairstow only score 13(17) that must be a big moment right? If malan had stayed, given his method he’d have better way more aggressively so his wicket was a big moment.'
'After Livingston 16th over people said that was a big moment in the game and England won it there, then Jordan Rashid over happened where it swung back to New Zealand and thne neesham got out on last ball so another big moment.\nIn 3 overs we had three big moments.'
